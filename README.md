# Machine_Learning_CI_CD

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are practices commonly used in software development to automate the process of integrating code changes, testing them, and deploying the updated application quickly. Initially, these practices were developed for traditional software applications, but they are now becoming increasingly relevant in machine learning (ML) projects as well.

In this module, we will take a look at CI/CD for ML and learn how to build our own machine learning pipeline that will automate the process of training, evaluating, and deploying the model.

We will learn how to use GitHub Actions, Makefile, CML, and Hugging Face CLI.

## Why CI/CD for Machine Learning?

CI/CD is a game-changer when it comes to operationalizing your model and using it to develop a product. Streamlining the automation process provides a bug-free, fast, and scalable solution for your ML project, allowing you to focus on improving the model rather than managing and deploying the solution.

In particular, CI/CD for machine learning helps with the following:

1. Automates training pipeline

With CI/CD, you can automatically retrain your models on new data on a regular schedule, saving time compared to manually triggering retraining.

2. Catches errors early

CI tools run tests and checks for each code commit, which helps to catch bugs, integration issues, and decreases in model performance.

3. Reproducibility

CI/CD helps ensure models can be rebuilt and retrained exactly the same way, enabling reproducibility of results. Environments, model and data versioning, and configurations are codified.

4. Testing and monitoring

CI/CD allows for automated testing of new models before deployment to check for issues. It also enables better monitoring of models post-deployment through integration with monitoring tools.

5. Faster iteration

New model versions or experiments can be quickly trained, tested, and deployed in an automated fashion with CI/CD. It accelerates the development and improvement of ML systems.

6. Scalability

As the ML project grows in size and complexity, managing the entire lifecycle manually becomes impractical. CI/CD pipelines provide a scalable solution that can handle large volumes of data, numerous models, and diverse dependencies while maintaining efficiency and reliability.

Below is a visual representation of the approach followed in this module.
